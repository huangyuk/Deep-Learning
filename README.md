# Deep-Learning

These are my homeworks of the deep learning course. This course covers neural networks, optimizations, and applications in computer vision and natural language processing. I went through the course videos twice to understand the principles, and then finished these guided projects. When there was a question, I discussed with my sister majoring in deep learning for three years.

Although these program frameworks were not developed by myself, I did dive into these codes and understand the usages of each lines. Also, these homeworks provides me a good example for developing new applications. Recently, I developed a vocabulary simlulator by upgrading one of the language model homework with the latest Tensorflow 2.
