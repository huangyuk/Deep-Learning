# Deep-Learning

These are my homeworks of the deep learning course. This course covers deep neural networks, optimization strategy, and applications in computer vision and natural language processing. I went through the course videos twice to understand the principles, and then finished these guided projects. When there was a question, I discussed with my sister majoring in deep learning for three years.

Although these program frameworks were not developed by myself, I did dive into these codes and understand the purposes of each line of codes. Finally, I upgraded the one about language model using the latest Tensorflow 2 framework in this summer.
